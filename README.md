# MonsterGrowth
first game made at Mediacollege Amsterdam - February-March 2014<br><br>

My first full game that i ever made!
Monster Growth was my first full game, with the help of game artists.. 
I was the only programmer in our team. There was another classmate working on it too, but he quit.
I used a Vector2D class that my teacher Berend Weij made for us when producing this game. 
The code is not my biggest achievement of the game, but back then it was!<br><br>
